                                TerraNexus is a platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers and vendors, ensuring fair pricing and access to fresh, local produce. Our website offers a streamlined and efficient way for both parties to connect and conduct business.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Farmers often struggle to find buyers who offer fair prices for their produce, while vendors face challenges in locating fresh, high-quality local food. TerraNexus addresses these issues by providing a direct connection between farmers and vendors, thereby facilitating better market access and pricing for both sides.

                            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2">How It Works</h6>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                <strong>For Farmers:</strong> Farmers can register on the platform, create a profile, and list their products with details such as type, quantity, and price range. They then receive offers from vendors, choose the best offer, and complete the transaction.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                <strong>For Vendors:</strong> Vendors register, set their criteria for purchasing (e.g., budget, quantity, quality), browse matched products, make offers, negotiate with farmers, and finalize purchases.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                                TerraNexus aims to build trust through user ratings and reviews, and ensures compliance with food sales regulations to provide a secure and reliable platform for all users.
